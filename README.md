# Computer Vision using VHDL and Xilinx
The code of this repo synthesizes into a highly-parallel architecture. If you check my 
report, you will see that almost all of the LUTs and slices were used were used, whereas
very few DFFs were consumed. The features extracted by my code are based on HOG, but
they had to be simplified due to time constraints. Again, all the details are explained
in my report
